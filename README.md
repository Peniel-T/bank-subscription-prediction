Bank Subscription Prediction

This project analyzes a direct marketing campaign dataset from a Portuguese banking institution to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. It covers exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and supervised machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes client information such as:
- Demographics: `age`, `job`, `marital`, `education`
- Financial behavior: `housing`, `loan`, `default`
- Marketing interaction: `contact`, `month`, `campaign`, `pdays`
- Economic indicators: `emp.var.rate`, `euribor3m`, `nr.employed`, etc.
- Target variable: `y` (whether a client subscribed to a term deposit)

Steps Performed

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed categorical and numerical distributions
   - Identified imbalances in the target variable
   - Visualized relationships across age, education, marital status

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Removed entries with `unknown` values
   - Handled outliers using IQR capping
   - Created new features like `age cluster` and `marital_edu`

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Mapped categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding
   - Dropped `duration` (leakage risk)
   - Converted target `y` to binary: `yes` = 1, `no` = 0

4. **Model Building & Evaluation**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

- F1-score (Class 1): 0.38
- **Best Parameters:** `max_depth=7`, `n_estimators=200`, `learning_rate=0.2`



 Insights & Recommendations

- Most subscribers fall within age 30â€“45, often professionals with higher education.
- Imbalanced classes: Majority of customers do **not** subscribe, making metrics like F1-score and recall crucial.
- Economic indicators like `euribor3m` and `emp.var.rate` showed strong influence on predictions.
- Future improvement: Try SMOTE or ensemble methods to handle class imbalance better.
